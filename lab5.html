    <div>
       <b> Electrostatics is a branch of physics that deals with the phenomena 
        and properties of stationary or slow-moving electric charges.</b>
        <br><br><br>
        Electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert
        on each other and are described by Coulomb's law.<br>

    <h2 id="a2">information about coulombs law</h2>
    <div>
        <em>
        according to coulombs law,the electric force for charges at rest has following properties:
        </em>
        <br><br>
        like chargees repel each other and unlike charges attract each other.
        <br>
        thus two negative or two positive repel each other while positive charges attract the negative charge.<br>

    <h2 id="a3">electric field</h2>
    <div>
        
        an electric field is an region where other charged particles experience a force.<br>
        imagine it like an invisible force field createed by electric charges.<br>
        if you place a positive charge in an letric field ,it will feel a 
        force pushing it away or pulling it towards th source of the field<br>
