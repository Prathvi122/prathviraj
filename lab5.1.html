        The conventional symbol for current is I<br>
        Current is the rate at which electrons flow past a point in a complete electrical circuit.<br>
        I for intensity. Amps is short for amperes. 
        The ampere is the unit of current, not another name for current itself.
         C is already used for capacitance.<br>

        Electric Current is the rate of flow of electrons in a conductor. The SI Unit of electric current is the Ampere.

        Electrons are minute particles that exist within the molecular structure of a substance.
        Sometimes, these electrons are tightly held, and other times they are loosely held. 
        When electrons are loosely held by the nucleus, they are able to travel freely within the limits of the body.
        Electrons are negatively charged particles hence when they move,
        a number of charges moves, and we call this movement of electrons as electric current.
        It should be noted that the number of electrons that are able to move governs the ability of a particular 
        substance to conduct electricity. Some materials allow the current to move better than others.
        Based on the ability of the material to conduct electricity, materials are classified into conductors and insulators.<br>
