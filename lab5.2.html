    <h2 id="a7">How current affects magnetic field</h2>
    <div>
        <b><em>when current flows the magnetic field is generated in the wire.</em></b><br>
        A magnetic field has both magnitude and direction. Hence, it is a vector quantity denoted by B (in the diagram below).<br>
         The magnetic field due to a current-carrying conductor depends on the conductor's current and the distance from the point.<br>
         The direction of the magnetic field is perpendicular to the wire.<br>
         To find the magnetic field at a radius r inside the wire, draw a circular loop of radius r.
          The magnetic field should still go in circular loops, just as it does outside the wire.
          So, inside the wire the magnetic field is proportional to r, while outside it's proportional to 1/r.
          The magnetic field lines around a straight current-carrying conductor are concentric circles whose centers lie on the conductor.
          A long, straight, current-carrying wire produces a magnetic field composed of concentric closed circles,
           and the field strength is given by 𝐵 = 𝜇 𝐼 2 𝜋 𝑑  .
         The strength of the magnetic field, 𝐵 , is inversely proportional to the distance away from the wire, 𝑑 .
